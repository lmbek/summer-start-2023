# summer-start-2023
A small Unity game project over the summer 2023 with Lars and Ida.

## note:
Everything is gitignored, the only things that are not gitignored are the script files and the scene files.
The whole project is kept on Computer locally (and transfered to new members like this, or by them making a new project from scratch).
The large files like PNG, JPG, FBX, Materials, 3d models etc. is synced by a service such as Synology Drive Client, Onedrive, Google drive or dropbox.
